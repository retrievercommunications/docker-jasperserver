The Docker Image aims to quickly get up-and-running a JasperReports Server for a development environment.

## Start the Container

### Using Command Line

To start the JasperServer container you'll need to pass in 5 environment variables and link it to either a MySQL or Postgres container.

E.g. `docker run -d --name jasperserver -e DB_TYPE=mysql -e DB_HOST=db -e DB_PORT=3306 -e DB_USER=root -e DB_PASSWORD=mysql --link jasperserver_mysql:db -p 8080:8080 retriever/jasperserver`

If you haven't got an existing MySQL or Postgres container then you can easily create one:
`docker run -d --name jasperserver_mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysql mysql:5.7`


### Using Docker-compose

To start up the JasperServer and a MySQL container:

* Run `docker-compose up` to run in foreground or
* Run `docker-compose up -d` to run as in daemon mode.

To stop the containers run `docker-compose stop` and `docker-compose start` to restart them.

Note: To install Docker-compose see the [releases page](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases).

## Image Features
This image includes:
* JasperServer CE Edition version 7.5.0
* IBM DB2 JDBC driver version 4.19.26, Note: this jar had to be modified as per [exception-in-db2-jcc-driver-under-tomcat8](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/308105/exception-in-db2-jcc-driver-under-tomcat8.html).
* MySQL JDBC driver version 5.1.44
* A volume called '/import' that allows automatic importing of export zip files from another JasperReports Server
* Waits for the database to start before connecting to it using [wait-for-it](https://github.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it) as recommended by [docker-compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/startup-order/).
* [Web Service Data Source plugin](https://community.jaspersoft.com/project/web-service-data-source) contributed by [@chiavegatto](https://github.com/chiavegatto)

## How to build this image
Use `docker build -t retriever/jasperserver .`

See comments in Dockerfile to speed up testing by not having to download the jasperserver release each time.

## Troubleshooting
If you are having problems starting the containers because of a MySQL error like "[ERROR] [FATAL] Innodb: Table flags are 0...", then you will need to delete the data_dir which contains the MySQL database and then recreate the containers. Please note that you will lose any data previously stored in the database.

## How to release a new image version
This repo is setup to trigger an automated build of the image [retriever/jaserpserver](https://hub.docker.com/r/retriever/jasperserver/) on Docker Hub.

To make a new official version of the image, just push a git Tag using the naming convention `major.minor.iteration` where:
* major and minor line up with the included version of jasperserver
* iteration is incremented each time a change is done that isn't an upgrade of the included jasperserver version
